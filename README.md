# pyside2-samples

PySide2 is powerful when creating UI but can be a pain digging through the documentation and plentiful of trial and error to try to achieve something that can be done easier with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (pretend I didn't say that woops).

This repo contains various samples that will be useful for beginner to PySide2 (or PySide6/PyQt5 but I'll be sticking to PySide2).

Not to forget Technical ~~Dictator~~ Director writing Python tools for ~~demanding~~ artists to boost their efficiency using customize art pipeline.

> Actually this repo serves as a mini blog whenever I wrote something that works after countless hours scouring PySide2 documentation, StackOverflow and Tech-Artists.org.

## Quick Setup

I'm using Python 3.8.9 so no guarantee it will work on older Python version. Probably a nuisance if you're using this for bundled Python in application like Maya on Windows where it is still on Python 2.7.

Will try my best to avoid Python 3 syntax and rely on fixed data when populating information in the PySide2 samples.

Also use virtual env!

```shell
python -m venv env

# On Windows
source env/Scripts/activate

# On Linux/macOS?
source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Just copy pasta I mean copy paste and modify as required!
1. Read through the sample code to understand what's going on.
1. ???
1. Profit.
